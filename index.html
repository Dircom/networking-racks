A lot of us get confused about the terms Server rack and Network rack. We assume that these are the same thing. But, that is not entirely true. Matter of fact, these are two different things.
<br />
If you are like most of us and don’t know the differences between a server rack and a network rack, you are right where you should be. <br />
Because in this post, we will be pointing out all the distinctions between these two products.
<br />
And, here we go…

    <h2>Server Rack</h2>
    <p> For the most part, the primary use of server racks is to accommodate server-related equipment. <br>
      To put it simply, a server rack is used to house a server computer which might contain equipment like <em>UPS ES, PSU, monitors, Media Storage Drives, Motherboard, CPU, Memory</em> and so on.
      <br>
The most common server racks come with <strong>36 inches depth and 24 inches height.</strong>
<br>
Aside from that, these server racks come in different types, shapes, and sizes. For instance, you might see a server rack which can be mounted on the wall. In contrast, there might be another which is portable and can only be placed on the floor.
<br>
Most of the server racks are designed keeping some key factors in mind like air flow, the safety of the pieces of equipment. So, most popular server racks come with secure doors and perforated side panels and front/rear.
</p>
<h2> Networking Rack</h2>
<p>
  Although both the server rack and network rack looks pretty identical, there’s a lot of differences there. <br>
  First of all, as the name suggests, a network rack is used to house networking related equipment like routers, network cables, switches, patch panels, and other accessories.
<br>
But, these network racks are very narrow in size. Usually, the depth of network racks won’t be higher than 31 inches. They do come with doors and side panels in most cases. But, they don’t have perforated doors.
<br>
Also, they are designed in a way so that it can be perfect for managing all the network cables easily.

    <tr>
      <td>In terms of height, a server rack can be similar to a network rack. But, in terms of depth, there can be dissimilarities. For instance, a server rack needs to contain bigger and larger equipment compared to a network rack. So, a server rack must have more depth than a network rack. Therefore, a server rack will take a bit more space than a network rack.</td>
      <td>Server racks will almost always have doors and side panels. Some of them can be locked from outside for further security. And, the front door and the rear panel might come with plenty of holes to allow required ventilation.
But, the network racks don’t have perforated doors usually. They come with tempered glass or polycarbonate doors. And most of the network racks don’t have any side panels.</td>
      <td>A server computer might not come with a lot of cables. Thus, it can be quite compact and also hard to do cable management in it. However, as it is likely that a network rack will have to contain a hefty amount of cables, it will have plenty of features for easy and fast cable management. That way, you will be able to keep all of your cables organized.</td>
